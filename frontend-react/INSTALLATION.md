# React Frontend Installation Guide

Due to network connectivity issues during the automatic installation, please follow these manual steps to set up the React frontend:

## Option 1: Manual Installation (Recommended)

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```powershell
   cd "D:\downloads\ai-youtube-quiz-generator-main\frontend-react"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies manually:**
   ```powershell
   # Try with different registry if default fails
   npm install --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   
   # Or use yarn if npm fails
   yarn install
   ```

3. **If still having network issues, try:**
   ```powershell
   # Clear npm cache
   npm cache clean --force
   
   # Install with longer timeout
   npm install --timeout=120000
   
   # Or use a different registry
   npm install --registry https://registry.yarnpkg.com/
   ```

## Option 2: Use Yarn Instead

If npm continues to fail, install with Yarn:

```powershell
# Install Yarn globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g yarn

# Install dependencies with Yarn
yarn install
```

## Option 3: Offline Installation

If you have consistent network issues:

1. Download the node_modules from a working machine
2. Copy to this directory
3. Run `npm rebuild` to ensure compatibility

## After Successful Installation

Once dependencies are installed successfully:

```powershell
# Copy environment file
copy .env.example .env

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The React application will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Backend Integration

The frontend is configured to proxy API requests to http://localhost:3001 (your existing backend). Make sure your backend server is running on that port.

## Next Steps

1. Install dependencies using one of the methods above
2. Start both backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000)
3. The React app will communicate with your existing backend
4. Customize components and add features as needed

The React frontend provides the same functionality as your Streamlit app but with modern web architecture, better performance, and enhanced user experience.
