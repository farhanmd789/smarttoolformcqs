# üìù Automatic Notes Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This feature automatically extracts and stores educational content from YouTube videos as detailed bullet points whenever a user generates a quiz. Notes are saved with timestamps and can be viewed, exported as PDF, and managed separately.

## What's New

### ‚ú® Key Features
1. **Automatic Note Generation**: Notes are generated automatically when you create a quiz
2. **Comprehensive Bullet Points**: Not just summaries - detailed key points from the video
3. **Organized Storage**: Notes saved with video title, channel, date, and time
4. **PDF Export**: Download notes as professionally formatted PDFs
5. **Note Management**: View, search, and delete notes
6. **Separate View**: Access notes anytime from the sidebar menu

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Notes Model (`models/Notes.js`)
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const notesSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  userId: { type: String, required: true },
  videoId: { type: String, required: true },
  videoTitle: { type: String },
  videoUrl: { type: String },
  channelTitle: { type: String },
  contentTitle: { type: String },
  bulletPoints: [{ type: String }],
  createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

notesSchema.index({ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 });

module.exports = mongoose.model('Notes', notesSchema);
```

### 2. Update Backend (`server.js`)
- Import Notes model
- Add `generateNotes()` function using Gemini AI
- Modify `/generate-quiz` endpoint to automatically save notes
- Add new endpoints:
  - `GET /notes/:userId` - Get all notes for a user
  - `GET /notes/:userId/:videoId` - Get notes for specific video
  - `DELETE /notes/:noteId` - Delete a note

### 3. Update Frontend (`app.py`)
- Add `get_notes()` function to fetch notes from backend
- Add `delete_note()` function for note management
- Add `generate_notes_pdf()` function for PDF export
- Add `display_notes_view()` function to show notes interface
- Update sidebar with "My Notes" view option

## How It Works

# üéØ New Features Implementation Guide

## Overview
Two powerful new features have been added to enhance the learning experience:
1. **Question Difficulty Settings** - Customizable quiz difficulty levels
2. **Personalized Learning Recommendations** - AI-powered study suggestions based on weak areas

---

## üéöÔ∏è Feature 1: Question Difficulty Settings

### What It Does
Allows users to adjust quiz difficulty based on their learning level and goals:
- **Easy** üü¢: Basic concepts, definitions, and recall questions
- **Medium** üü°: Understanding, application, and mixed question types
- **Hard** üî¥: Advanced analysis, critical thinking, and problem-solving

### How It Works

#### Backend Implementation
The `generateQuiz()` function now accepts a `difficulty` parameter that adjusts:
- Question complexity
- Language sophistication
- Distractor quality (incorrect answer options)
- Question types (recall vs. analysis)
- Topic depth

```javascript
// Example API call
POST /generate-quiz
{
  "youtube_url": "...",
  "num_questions": 15,
  "difficulty": "hard"  // easy, medium, or hard
}
```

#### Frontend UI
- **Sidebar slider**: Visual difficulty selector with descriptions
- **Color-coded indicators**: üü¢ Easy, üü° Medium, üî¥ Hard
- **Real-time feedback**: Shows current difficulty before generation
- **Quiz display**: Difficulty badge shown during quiz

### Difficulty Characteristics

| Difficulty | Question Focus | Distractor Quality | Best For |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| Easy | Definitions, basic facts | Clearly incorrect | Beginners, quick review |
| Medium | Concepts, relationships | Plausible but incorrect | Most learners, understanding |
| Hard | Analysis, application | Subtle, requires thought | Advanced learners, mastery |

### User Experience Flow
1. User selects difficulty in sidebar
2. Visual confirmation of selected level
3. Quiz generates with appropriate complexity
4. Results show difficulty level completed
5. History tracks difficulty per quiz
